        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p class="info">Responsive Web Design is an approach to web design that aims to make webpages adaptive and flexible. Its aim is to keep all content in properly rendered when changing screen sizes. It does this to ensure readability, usability, and end-user satisfaction.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p class="info">A Responsive Web Design is arguably the most important thing you need for a website besides the content of the website itself. It makes everything easier to look at, read, and understand for the end user. Whether they are using a phone, laptop, desktop, tablet, etc; They can read and understand the webpage. Accessibility users can know whats on the webpage. Images aren't stretched out or covering anything up. All this makes the website more desirable to stay on.</p>
      </section>
      <!-- flexible images section -->
      <section class="main-section" id="flexible_images">
        <h2>Flexible Images</h2>
        <p class="info">One of the principles in Responsive Web Design is having flexible images. This means that when the screen changes size, the image changes as well. Of course the image will already change simply because the screen size is changing, but you don't want it to get too small, stretched, or distorted in any way.</p>
        <p class="indent">One technique to help images scale correctly is shown below.</p>
        <pre><code>
        .img {
          max-width: 100%;
        }
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <!-- media queries section -->
      <section class="main-section" id="media_queries">
        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <p class="info">Media queries are selectors for the screen size. You can set the query to be a minimum screen size and over and/or a max screen size and under. These are used for when you need the webpage to be formatted differently when it hits a certain screen size.</p>
        <p class="indent">Here is an example of both min and max size being used, but both are not required:</p>
        <pre><code>
        @media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px) {
          .class {
            color: #ffffff;
            width: 50%;
          }
        }
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <!-- viewport meta tag section -->
      <section class="main-section" id="viewport_meta_tag">
        <h2>Viewport Meta Tag</h2>
        <p class="info">The viewport meta tag is a meta element that goes in the header, like any other meta element. Normally, when a webpage that was made for desktop is viewed on a mobile device, the content gets shrunk to fit on the screen, resulting in tiny words and images. With the viewport meta tag, the content's width is adjusted to fit on the screen. </p>
        <p class="indent">The Viewport Meta tag:</p>
        <pre><code>
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <!-- mobile first design section -->
      <section class="main-section" id="mobile_first_design">
        <h2>Mobile First Design</h2>
        <p class="info">Mobile first design is another principle in responsive web design. As the name implies, you first design the website to a mobile layout. You do this because on a mobile screen you have the least amount of room to work with. Once you've gotten the mobile layout done, designing the expanded layout will be much easier.</p>
      </section>
      <!-- flexbox section -->
      <section class="main-section" id="flexbox">
        <h2>Flexbox</h2>
        <p class="info">Flexbox is a CSS layout module designed to create flexible and efficient layouts. Itâ€™s particularly useful for aligning items in a row or column and distributing space within a container, even when the size of the items is unknown or dynamic.</p>
        <p class="indent">Flex container: </p>
        <pre><code>
        /* this will create the flexbox */
        .container {
          display: flex; 
        } 
        </code></pre>
        <p class="indent">Now you can either adjust the content horizontally with justify-content: or vertically with align-items:</p> 
        <pre><code>
        /* adjust items horizontally */
        .container {
          display: flex;
          justify-content: space-between;
        }
  
        /* adjust items vertically */
        .container {
          display: flex;
          align-items: center;
        }
        </code></pre>
        <!-- add more property examples like flex-direction and flex-wrap -->
      </section>
      <!-- section about css grid to complement flexbox -->
      <section class="main-section" id="css_grid">
        <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
        <p class="info">CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows you to create complex, responsive web designs with ease. It provides a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, enabling you to control both rows and columns simultaneously.</p>
        <p class="indent">To create a grid container, you can use the following CSS:</p>
        <pre><code>
        /* this will create the grid container */
        .container {
          display: grid;
          grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
          grid-gap: 10px;
        }
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <!-- conclusion section -->
      <section class="main-section" id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="info">Responsive Web Design is essential for creating user-friendly websites that adapt to various devices and screen sizes. By implementing flexible images, media queries, viewport meta tags, mobile-first design, and layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid, you can ensure your website provides an optimal viewing experience for all users.</p>
        <p class="info">By following these principles, you can create a website that is not only visually appealing but also functional and accessible across different devices.</p>
